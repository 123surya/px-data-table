v0.0.1
==================
* Initial release

v1.0.0
==================
* Now possible to set a column as 'editable' and allow the cell to be selected and the content edited.
* Per-cell validation is now possible. As a cell is edited and the change accepted a (developer supplied) validation routine is executed, a cell will be marked as invalid if it fails the validation routine.
